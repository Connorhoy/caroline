                <p>It's been a crazy year we a lot of changed, and some of that change certinaly wasn't easy. I appreciate you being so patient. Bless you, you're the most patient person in the world. I know that. Physically, you're at Campbell and I'm in Charlotte. But you're always in my heart, and the heart is home.
                <br><br>
                On that note, I feel that in our relationship were stronger than ever now, as we've been through so much together. In the past 8 months alone we've braved me going to army training for 4.5 months, you starting college and being away. Most couples would've quit on each other a long time ago, but we're no ordinary couple. We stuck through and kicked butt.
